Welcome to the OOD-Adventure Sim project!

Here's how to compile all files at once:
javac Commands/*.java People/*.java Quests/*.java Tests/*.java UI/*.java Weapons/*.java Adventure.java

Then run either:
java Adventure.java           (plays the game)
java Tests/PatternTester.java (runs tests on patterns)

Enjoy!
